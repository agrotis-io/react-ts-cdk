> ðŸ”¥ React + Typescript Boilerplate to develop your own react components and reuse in another projects

![React Typescript Component Development Kit](images/intro.jpg)

## Motivation
Components are cool! We should use them everywhere. So, you expent time developing a lot of components and now you want to reuse them in another awesome project & all your projects need your components updated when a new feature is released (and you also need typechecking, tests, hot module replacement & all the good stuff).

## Directory Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ src
|   â””â”€â”€ components
|       â””â”€â”€ MyComponent                 # Your component
|           â”œâ”€â”€ MyComponent.tsx         # Its JSX + Typescript file
|           â”œâ”€â”€ MyComponent.story.tsx   # Storybook of your component
|           â”œâ”€â”€ types.tsx               # Types for props
|           â””â”€â”€ tests.js                # Jest + Enzyme tests
|       â””â”€â”€ MyComponentX                # Another component X
|       â””â”€â”€ MyComponentY                # Another component Y
|       â””â”€â”€ MyComponentZ                # Another component Z
|       â””â”€â”€ stories.tsx                 # Storybook config file
â”œâ”€â”€ dist
|    â””â”€â”€ index.js                       # Exporting all Componentss
